Follow Focus Gear - LOMO Anamorphic Primes
=============

Follow focus rings for the 50mm and 75mm Lomo anamorphic primes, with standard 0.8mm ptich.

Designed to tightly press fit over the focus ring, so some slight sanding of the inside of the gear may be needed for your particular lens.

The inside of the gear is designed with a slightly larger radius to fit perfectly over the knurled section of the focus ring.

Designed with [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/).
